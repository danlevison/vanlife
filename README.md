# #VANLIFE

[#VANLIFE](https://yourvanlife.netlify.app/) is a campervan rental site built using React.

This project was inspired by a solo project that I completed on Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path.

## Features

- Assistants API: Using OpenAI's new Assistants API, I built my own custom AI assistant that can leverage models, tools and knowledge to respond to user queries.
- Authentication: I integrated Supabase authentication allowing users to sign up/in with email and password or their gmail account.
- Filtering: Users can apply filters to navigate through the selection of campervans. Applied filters are stored in URL params to prevent loss of filters when navigating back and forth between campervan pages.
- Navigation: I implemented React Router 6 to facilitate seamless navigation within the app, ensuring a smooth user experience across various pages and components.
- Shadcn/ui: I integrated the shadcn/ui component collection using their cli. This proved to be instrumental in incorporating stylish and reusable elements, including loading skeletons and accordions, further enriching the app's functionalities.
- User-friendly Interface: The website offers an intuitive and visually appealing interface that is styled with Tailwind CSS.
