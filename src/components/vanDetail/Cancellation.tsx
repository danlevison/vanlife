			<p className="leading-relaxed">
				We understand that plans can change, and we strive to provide flexible
				options for our valued customers. If you decide to cancel your
				reservation 20 or more days before your scheduled pick-up date, you will
				receive a full refund of the amount you paid up to that date. For
				cancellations made within the window of less than 20 days but more than
				72 hours before your scheduled check-in date, there are two options: You
				can receive a 50% refund of the booking value or alternatively, you can
				opt for a travel voucher for the full amount of your booking value, with
				a deduction of a 15% cancellation fee. Please note that both options are
				applicable only if you've already paid the full amount of your booking
				value. Unfortunately, if you need to cancel your reservation within 72
				hours of the scheduled check-in date, we won't be able to provide any
				refund or travel voucher. We value your understanding and hope that
				these flexible options cater to your needs when planning your travels.
